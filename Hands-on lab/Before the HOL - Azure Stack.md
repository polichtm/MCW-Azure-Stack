# Choose your lab

This content consists of two hands-on lab paths, **Azure Stack Hub** and **Azure Stack Hub Operations**. You should only complete the setup for the lab you wish to complete. You may use the table of contents to navigate to the appropriate instructions. The descriptions below are provided to help you decide which lab you would like to complete. 

The first hands-on lab involves starts with deploying the Azure Stack Hub Development Kit, deploying the SQL Database and Azure App Service resource providers, as well as downloading several virtual machine images from the Azure Stack Hub Marketplace. From there, you will implement a full taxonomy in Azure Stack Hub consisting of a region, subscription, plan, offer, and quotas. After Azure Stack Hub is configured, you will then deploy Azure SQL Database, Web and API apps and then deploy the Contoso application.

The second hands-on lab focuses on the Azure Stack Hub operational tasks. In this case, you will also start with deploying the Azure Stack Hub Development Kit, but the subsequent steps will differ. First, you will install the Azure Stack Hub tools. You will subsequently rely on them to create and publish a custom Azure Marketplace item as well as to implement multi-tenant topology by provisioning another Azure Active Directory tenant and adding it to the existing Azure Stack Hub environment. Once that is completed, you will set up delegation by using the delegated provider model and Azure Stack Hub Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). You will conclude this lab by carrying out common Azure Stack Hub maintenance tasks, including log collection (via Privileged Endpoint) and infrastructure backup (by using the Azure Stack Hub Admin portal).

4.  From the Administrator: Windows PowerShell ISE window, register the Azure Stack Hub resource provider by running the following:

    ```powershell
    Register-AzureRmResourceProvider -ProviderNamespace Microsoft.AzureStack
    ```

5.  From the Administrator: Windows PowerShell ISE window, configure the registration by running the following:

    ```powershell
    Set-Location -Path '\AzureStack-Tools-master'
    # Import the registration module that was downloaded with the GitHub tools
    Import-Module -Name '.\Registration\RegisterWithAzure.psm1'

    ```

6.  From the Administrator: Windows PowerShell ISE window, connect to the privileged endpoint of your ASDK installation by running the following:

    ```powershell
    $adminUserName = 'azurestack\CloudAdmin'
    $adminPassword = 'demo@pass123' | ConvertTo-SecureString -Force -AsPlainText
    $adminCredentials = New-Object PSCredential($adminUserName,$adminPassword)

    Enter-PSSession -ComputerName AzS-ERCS01 -ConfigurationName PrivilegedEndpoint -Credential $adminCredentials
    ```

7.  From the `[AzS-ERC01]: PS>` prompt within the Administrator: Windows PowerShell ISE window, display the local Azure Stack Hub stamp information by running the following:

    ```powershell
    Get-AzureStackStampInformation 
    ```

8.  In the output of the command you ran in the previous step, identify the CloudId parameter, copy it to Clipboard, and exit the PowerShell Remoting session by running the following:

    ```powershell
    Exit-PSSession
    ```

9.  From the Administrator: Windows PowerShell ISE window, configure the registration by running the following (make sure to replace the placeholder `<cloud_ID>` with the value of the CloudId parameter you identified in the previous step):

    ```powershell
    $RegistrationName = "<cloud_ID>"
    $AzureContext = Get-AzureRmContext

    Set-AzsRegistration `
	-PrivilegedEndpointCredential $adminCredentials `
	-PrivilegedEndpoint AzS-ERCS01 `
	-BillingModel Development `
	-RegistrationName $RegistrationName `
	-UsageReportingEnabled:$true
    ```

10. Review the output of the command you ran in the previous task and verify that the registration was successful.

You should complete these instructions *before* attending the workshop.
