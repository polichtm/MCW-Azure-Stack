# Azure Stack hands-on lab step-by-step

## Abstract and learning objectives

In this hands-on lab, you will perform common Azure Stack operational tasks by using the Azure Stack Development Kit. You will start by creating and publishing a custom Azure Marketplace item. Next, you will implement multi-tenant topology by provisioning another Azure Active Directory tenant and adding it to the existing Azure Stack environment. Once that is completed, you will set up delegation by using the delegated provider model and Azure Stack Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). You will conclude this lab by carrying out common Azure Stack operational tasks, including log collection (via Privileged Endpoint) and infrastructure backup (by using the Azure Stack Admin portal).

## Overview

Contoso Finance is one of the largest banks in the United States with a significant amount of their revenue coming from their residential mortgage business. As part of Contoso's shift to a cloud first strategy they planning to migrate their loan web applications to a hybrid cloud solution. 

As the result of a recent acquisition of a financial analytics company named Fabrikam, based in Houston, Texas, Contoso IT management team plans to integrate a number of Fabrikam's internally developed applications to process and analyze the customer data being used by the Contoso's customer facing mortgage application. Fabrikam has skilled development and infrastructure teams, with extensive Azure experience and its own Azure Active Directory tenant. Contoso is very interested in leveraging that experience and plans to offer the Fabrikam IT team sufficient level of autonomy when working on the integration tasks. That autonomy should include the ability of the Fabrikam IT team to offer to their users cloud resources required for application development, implementation, and maintenance. At the same time, Contoso wants to ensure proper governance and facilitate implementation of corporate standards via centralized control of the service catalog content and through automation. 

During the planning stages, Contoso realized they would not be able to retain their customer data in US based Azure regions due to corporate compliance policies and regulatory issues. They have selected Azure Stack as the deployment method to take advantage of Azure technologies while still maintaining compliance.

To help design a solution using Azure technologies, Contoso has engaged a Microsoft Cloud Partner and Service Provider FusionTomo (FT). FT is a full-service hosting provider in North America certified to deliver Azure services with connectivity solutions and partnerships to provide ExpressRoute and other telecom services. They have datacenters located in Denver, London, Las Vegas, Dallas and Hong Kong SAR.

Contoso has expressed to FT the need to embrace Microsoft Azure technologies as well as technologies that will help their organization with a more agile continuous integration and continuous deployment model for application deployment. Contoso also underscored the need for cooperation with Fabrikam's integration teams, including the intent to delegate some of the infrastructure management tasks. 

With these goals in mind, Contoso has challenged FT to help implement the hosted environment must also accommodate requirements regarding integration work to be carried out by Fabrikam. In addition, as internal workloads are transitioned to the hosting environment, Contoso internal audit team must retain its ability to track all of the infrastructure changes. For compliance purposes, the delegation model that will provide Contoso and Fabrikam staff with insight into the hosted environment must comply with the principle of least privilege. To satisfy Contoso governance requirements, FT must document standard operating procedures that will be carried out within the hosted infrastructure.

1.  On the storage account blade, select **Blobs**.

1.  On the Blob service blade, select **+ Container**.

1.  In the Name textbox, type **packages** and in the **Access type** drop down list, select **Blob (anonymous read access for blobs only)**

1.  In the list of containers, select **packages**.

1.  On the packages blade, select **Upload**.

1.  On the upload blob blade, select the folder icon next to the **Select a file** text box. 

1.  In the Choose File to Upload text box, navigate to the location containing the package that you noted in the previous task, select the **Contoso.ContosoWebApp.1.0.0.azpkg** file and select **Open**.

    ![In the Azure Stack Admin portal, the Upload blob pane shows the Contoso.ContosoWebApp.1.0.0.azpkg file to be uploaded.](images.operations/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-AzureStackimages/media/image5.png)

1.  Back on the Upload blob blade, select **Upload**.

    > **Note:** Subsequent steps require Azure Stack PowerShell and tools installed. This was performed as part of **Azure Stack Before the Hands-on Lab setup guide**)

1.  From the Administrator: Windows PowerShell ISE window, sign in to the Azure Stack as operator by running the following (make sure to replace the placeholder <tenant_name> with the name of your Azure Active Directory tenant)

    ```powershell
    Set-Location -Path '\AzureStack-Tools-master'

    Add-AzureRMEnvironment -Name "AzureStackAdmin" -ArmEndpoint "https://adminmanagement.local.azurestack.external" `
      -AzureKeyVaultDnsSuffix adminvault.local.azurestack.external `
      -AzureKeyVaultServiceEndpointResourceId https://adminvault.local.azurestack.external

    $AuthEndpoint = (Get-AzureRmEnvironment -Name "AzureStackAdmin").ActiveDirectoryAuthority.TrimEnd('/')
    $AADTenantName = "<tenant_name>.onmicrosoft.com"
    $TenantId = (Invoke-RestMethod "$($AuthEndpoint)/$($AADTenantName)/.well-known/openid-configuration").issuer.TrimEnd('/').Split('/')[-1]

    Add-AzureRmAccount -EnvironmentName "AzureStackAdmin" -TenantId $TenantId

    ```
1.  When prompted, sign in with your Azure Active Directory account that you provided when provisioning the Azure Stack environment.

1.  From the Administrator: Windows PowerShell ISE window, publish the package to Azure Stack Marketplace by running the following (make sure to replace the placeholder <storageaccountname> with the name of the storage account you created earlier in this task):

    ```
    Add-AzsGalleryItem -GalleryItemUri `
      https://<storageaccountname>.blob.local.azurestack.external/packages/Contoso.ContosoWebApp.1.0.0.azpkg -Verbose
    ```

1.  Ensure that the command completes successfully.

1.  Switch back to the Azure Stack Admin portal, in the hub menu, select **+ Create a resource**.

    > **Note:** Alternatively, you can use the Azure Stack User portal at <https://portal.local.azurestack.external/>. The newly added Marketplace item should be available in both.

1.  On the New blade, select **Custom**.

1.  On the Custom blade, select **See all** and ensure that **Contoso WebApp** appears in the list of resource types to provision.

    > **Note:** It might take a few minutes for a newly added Marketplace item to appear

    ![In the Azure Stack Admin portal, Contoso WebApp custom Marketplace item is displayed.](images.operations/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-AzureStackimages/media/image6.png)

1.  On the Custom blade, select **Contoso WebApp**.

1.  On the Contoso webapp blade, review the interface of the Contoso webapp blade to verify that it reflects the configuration you specified when creating the package.

1.  On the Contoso webapp blade, select **Create**

1.  Step through the process of configuring the deployment but do not select **Create**.

1.  Close all open windows.

    > **Note:** In general, in order to ensure that the new Azure Stack Marketplace item is functional, you also need to satisfy all of the prerequisites for its deployment, such as OS images referenced by a VM template, are in place. 


## Exercise 2: Implement multi-tenancy

Duration: 30 minutes

In this exercise, you will implement Azure Stack multi-tenancy.

### Task 1: Create and configure a new Azure Active Directory tenant
