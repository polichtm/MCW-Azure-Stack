# Azure Stack hands-on lab step-by-step

## Abstract and learning objectives

In this hands-on lab, you will deploy the Azure Stack Development Kit and deploy the SQL Database and Azure App Service resource providers, as well as download several virtual machine images from the Azure Stack Marketplace. From there, you will implement a full taxonomy in Azure Stack consisting of a region, subscription, plan, offer, and quotas. After Azure Stack is configured, you will then deploy Azure SQL Database, Web and API apps and then deploy the Contoso application.

At the end of this hands-on lab, you will be better able to deploy and manage solutions running on Azure Stack.

## Overview

Contoso Finance is one of the largest banks in the United States with a significant amount of their revenue coming from their residential mortgage business. As part of Contoso's shift to a cloud first strategy they planning to migrate their loan web applications to a hybrid cloud solution. During the planning stages, Contoso realized they would not be able to retain their customer data in US based Azure regions due to corporate compliance policies and regulatory issues. They have selected Azure Stack as the deployment method to take advantage of Azure technologies while still maintaining compliance.

## Solution architecture

## Exercise 4: Automating backend processes with Azure functions 

Duration: 15-30 minutes

Contoso wants to automate the process of generating applications in PDF format and using Azure Functions. In this exercise, you will provision a Function App using the Azure Stack portal. This Function App will watch the Azure Storage Queue for a message that the web application has submitted, process the application creating a PDF and storing it in Azure Blob Storage.

### Task 1: Create an Azure function to generate PDF receipts

1.  From your Azure Stack Host, navigate to the following repository: and click **Clone or download**, and then **Download ZIP**. After the file is downloaded, extract it to a new folder.

    ```
    https://github.com/opsgility/contosofinancefunction
    ```

    ![In the Azure Stack Host, the Clone or download button is selected, and under Clone with HTTPS, the Download ZIP button is selected.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-AzureStackimages/media/image139.png)

## After the hands-on lab 

Duration: 10 minutes

In this final task you will clean up the Azure Resources that you have create for the hands-on lab. This task is optional.
