# Choose your lab

This content consists of two hands-on lab paths, **Azure Stack Hub** and **Azure Stack Hub Operations**. You should verify that you have completed the setup in the *Before the hands-on lab* guide for the lab you wish to complete. You may use the table of contents to navigate to the appropriate instructions. The descriptions below are provided to help you decide which lab you would like to complete. 

The first hands-on lab involves starts with deploying the Azure Stack Hub Development Kit, deploying the SQL Database and Azure App Service resource providers, as well as downloading several virtual machine images from the Azure Stack Hub Marketplace. From there, you will implement a full taxonomy in Azure Stack Hub consisting of a region, subscription, plan, offer, and quotas. After Azure Stack Hub is configured, you will then deploy Azure SQL Database, Web and API apps and then deploy the Contoso application.

The second hands-on lab focuses on the Azure Stack Hub operational tasks. In this case, you will also start with deploying the Azure Stack Hub Development Kit, but the subsequent steps will differ. First, you will install the Azure Stack Hub tools. You will subsequently rely on them to create and publish a custom Azure Marketplace item as well as to implement multi-tenant topology by provisioning another Azure Active Directory tenant and adding it to the existing Azure Stack Hub environment. Once that is completed, you will set up delegation by using the delegated provider model and Azure Stack Hub Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). You will conclude this lab by carrying out common Azure Stack Hub maintenance tasks, including log collection (via Privileged Endpoint) and infrastructure backup (by using the Azure Stack Hub administrator portal).

# Azure Stack Hub hands-on lab step-by-step

## Abstract and learning objectives

In this hands-on lab, you will deploy the Azure Stack Hub Development Kit and deploy the SQL Database and Azure App Service resource providers, as well as download several virtual machine images from the Azure Stack Hub Marketplace. From there, you will implement a full taxonomy in Azure Stack Hub consisting of a region, subscription, plan, offer, and quotas. After Azure Stack Hub is configured, you will then deploy Azure SQL Database, Web and API apps and then deploy the Contoso application.

At the end of this hands-on lab, you will be better able to deploy and manage solutions running on Azure Stack Hub.

## Overview

Contoso Finance is one of the largest banks in the United States with a significant amount of their revenue coming from their residential mortgage business. As part of Contoso's shift to a cloud first strategy they planning to migrate their loan web applications to a hybrid cloud solution. During the planning stages, Contoso realized they would not be able to retain their customer data in US based Azure regions due to corporate compliance policies and regulatory issues. They have selected Azure Stack Hub as the deployment method to take advantage of Azure technologies while still maintaining compliance.

## Solution architecture

![The Microsoft Azure Stack Hub is made up of Mortgage Applications and Mortgage Admin databases, Offerings API, Storage Queue Mortgage Applications, Mortgage Applications, and SQL Web App DB and Customer Data.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-AzureStackimages/media/image2.png "Solution Architecture")

You should follow all steps provided *after* attending the Hands-on lab.

>**Note**: This is the end of the *Azure Stack Hub* hands-on lab path. The steps that follow are for the *Azure Stack Hub Operations* hands-on lab path. If you wish to do this lab as well, you should verify that you have completed the prerequisite steps for *Azure Stack Hub Operations* in the before the hands-on lab guide.

# Azure Stack Hub Operations hands-on lab step-by-step

## Abstract and learning objectives

In this hands-on lab, you will perform common Azure Stack Hub operational tasks by using the Azure Stack Hub Development Kit. You will start by creating and publishing a custom Azure Marketplace item. Next, you will implement multi-tenant topology by provisioning another Azure Active Directory tenant and adding it to the existing Azure Stack Hub environment. Once that is completed, you will set up delegation by using the delegated provider model and Azure Stack Hub Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). You will conclude this lab by carrying out common Azure Stack Hub operational tasks, including log collection (via Privileged Endpoint) and infrastructure backup (by using the Azure Stack Hub administrator portal).

## Overview

Contoso Finance is one of the largest banks in the United States with a significant amount of their revenue coming from their residential mortgage business. As part of Contoso's shift to a cloud first strategy they planning to migrate their loan web applications to a hybrid cloud solution. 

As the result of a recent acquisition of a financial analytics company named Fabrikam, based in Houston, Texas, Contoso IT management team plans to integrate a number of Fabrikam's internally developed applications to process and analyze the customer data being used by the Contoso's customer facing mortgage application. Fabrikam has skilled development and infrastructure teams, with extensive Azure experience and its own Azure Active Directory tenant. Contoso is very interested in leveraging that experience and plans to offer the Fabrikam IT team sufficient level of autonomy when working on the integration tasks. That autonomy should include the ability of the Fabrikam IT team to offer to their users cloud resources required for application development, implementation, and maintenance. At the same time, Contoso wants to ensure proper governance and facilitate implementation of corporate standards via centralized control of the service catalog content and through automation. 

During the planning stages, Contoso realized they would not be able to retain their customer data in US based Azure regions due to corporate compliance policies and regulatory issues. They have selected Azure Stack Hub as the deployment method to take advantage of Azure technologies while still maintaining compliance.

To help design a solution using Azure technologies, Contoso has engaged a Microsoft Cloud Partner and Service Provider FusionTomo (FT). FT is a full-service hosting provider in North America certified to deliver Azure services with connectivity solutions and partnerships to provide ExpressRoute and other telecom services. They have datacenters located in Denver, London, Las Vegas, Dallas and Hong Kong SAR.

Contoso has expressed to FT the need to embrace Microsoft Azure technologies as well as technologies that will help their organization with a more agile continuous integration and continuous deployment model for application deployment. Contoso also underscored the need for cooperation with Fabrikam's integration teams, including the intent to delegate some of the infrastructure management tasks. 

With these goals in mind, Contoso has challenged FT to help implement the hosted environment which must also accommodate requirements regarding integration work to be carried out by Fabrikam. In addition, as internal workloads are transitioned to the hosting environment, Contoso internal audit team must retain its ability to track all of the infrastructure changes. For compliance purposes, the delegation model that will provide Contoso and Fabrikam staff with insight into the hosted environment must comply with the principle of least privilege. To satisfy Contoso governance requirements, FT must document standard operating procedures that will be carried out within the hosted infrastructure.
